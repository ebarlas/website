<h1>Summary</h1>
I'm a generalist software engineer specializing in backend Java web applications deployed in AWS Cloud.
I am a thoughtful, deliberate, hard-working developer who seeks simple, minimal, and scalable solutions
to problems. I have a record of stewarding and evolving software systems over the course of many years
while maintaining high quality code and employing modern techniques. I enjoy a range of computer programming languages,
paradigms, and platforms. I am endlessly curious and fascinated by topics in the field of computing, and I am constantly
engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. In my role as tech lead, I try to cultivate an atmosphere of growth and learning
among my colleagues. I also enjoy teaching computer programming topics to newcomers as a volunteer at the
local CoderDojo chapter and at Santa Rosa Junior College.

<h2>Coder Dojo</h2>
<h3>Petaluma Public Library</h3>
<p>January 2017 - August 2018</p>
<p>
    The local chapter of CoderDojo met weekly for an hour at the Petaluma Public Library. I was a mentor

    I organized the Java User Group in Santa Barbara using the Meetup.com platform. Meetings were roughly quarterly
    and covered topics ranging from Java release news to vector graphics programming on Android to WebSocket programming
    with Java EE. I arranged speakers, scheduled events, ordered meals, and cultivated a welcoming
    atmosphere for attendees of all backgrounds.
